    <p> The demand for globalization requires the development of skilled and fully educated human resources to meet the ever changing challenges for aachieving competitive labor force. To attain these, all learning institution must endeavor to harness the potentioals of their students to attain competitive graduates. Toward this end, a higher educational institution (HEI) was established after a survey was conducted by way of random sampling of parents from La Union and from the north and western towns of Pangasinan whose children are in elementary and secondary schools and could be prospective students of the proposed HEI.</p>
    <p>After the organizational meeting of the incorporators, the organizartion came up with the name Philippine College of Northwestern Luzon (PCNL) with the articles of incorporation aand by - laws duly approved by the Securities and Exchange Commision, Baguio Extension office on the 20 day of February 2007.</p>

While the institution was waiting for the approval of Commision on Higher Education(CHED), the Board of Trustees composed of 9 members of the 15 incorporators likewise preferred the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) requirements for offering short term courses. After the visit of TESDA technical panel, the institution was granted a permit to offer four short term courses namely Computer Hardware Servicing NC II, PC Operations NC II, and Tourism Housekeeping NS II  which started the 1st semester of school year 2007-2008.</p>
    <p>On February 2008, the courses approved by CHED are BSBA and BSA to be offered first during the first semester of school year 2008-2009. The following yearm BSE and BEE were approved followed by BSIT and CRIMINOLOGY respectively.</p>

    <p>PCML located in a environment conductive to learning and developing. It is away from places of questionable character such as gambling establishments, drinking joints and videooke bars. There are no manufacturing and industrial establishment near the school and science laboratories. There are 11 classrooms, a housekeeping room and spacious library and in front is an open court. Based on its 5-year development plan(2007-2012) the college will continue constructing and upgrading its facilities. The initial investment was P3,900,900.00. </p>
